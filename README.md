•	Conducted A/B testing using Python (SciPy) to evaluate the impact of wait-time adjustments on rider behavior, applying t-tests and hypothesis testing to assess statistical significance across time-of-day segments
•	Identified that shorter wait times during peak commute hours led to a significant drop in cancellations without raising operational costs, enabling the development of a dynamic, hour-specific strategy that improved rider retention and boosted profitability
